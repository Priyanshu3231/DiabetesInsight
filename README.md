# Diabetes Prediction

## Overview
This project uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of a person developing diabetes based on various health metrics such as age, BMI, blood pressure, and more. The model analyzes this data and provides a prediction of whether the person is diabetic or not, aiding in early diagnosis and awareness.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebooks

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, which contains medical data for diabetes diagnosis. The features include various health parameters like age, BMI, insulin levels, blood pressure, etc.

## How It Works
1. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is cleaned, missing values are handled, and data is normalized for consistency.
2. **Model Training**: A machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or SVM) is trained using the preprocessed data.
3. **Evaluation**: The model is tested on unseen data, and performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are calculated.
4. **Prediction**: The trained model is used to predict the likelihood of diabetes in new data points.
